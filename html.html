- empty and self closing tag is called <br> tag because it has no closing tags

CREATING LINKS:
- to start this we add the texts in between <a>and</a>tags. <a> stands for anchor tag.
	ex: <a>learn to code</a>
- to link the text to a webpage we add href="" along with a uniform resource locator(url) href is a short of hypertext reference.
        ex: <a href="https://mimo.org">learn to code</a>
- href is an attribute.all attributes have two things in common: they provide extra information and they go inside the opening tag.
- attributes are added after the name of the tag,and before the closing tag.

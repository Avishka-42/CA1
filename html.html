HTML TAGS,TEXTS AND HEADINGS:
- <button>txt</button> it is used for creating buttons
- <p>paragraph</p>
- <h1></h2> it is the largest size in font and <h6></h6> it is the smallest size in font

LINE BREAKS EMPHASIS AND IMPORTANCE:
- <strong></strong> to make text bold and important
- <em></em> emphasis to texts and it make text italic
- <br> to break in sentences and closing break tag is not used
- empty and self closing tag is called <br> tag because it has no closing tags

CREATING LINKS:
- to start this we add the texts in between <a>and</a>tags. <a> stands for anchor tag.
	ex: <a>learn to code</a>
- to link the text to a webpage we add href="" along with a uniform resource locator(url) href is a short of hypertext reference.
        ex: <a href="https://mimo.org">learn to code</a>
- href is an attribute.all attributes have two things in common: they provide extra information and they go inside the opening tag.
- attributes are added after the name of the tag,and before the closing tag.
- we link to a webpage by adding = after the attribute and a url as a value in between quotes.
       ex: <!doctype html>
           <html>
           <body>
           <a href = "https : //mimo.org">learn to code</a>
	   </body>
	   </html>
- attribute are for to provide additional information about tags.

ADDING IMAGES:
- to add images to the webpage we start with<img> tag.
- <img> is a empty tag, it has no closing tag.
- to display an image ,an image tag needs the src attribute. src stands for source.
  ex: <img src="https://mimo.app/i/earth.png">
- we can use attributes to change the size of images.the width and height attributes use pixles as the default unit of measurement.
for example,to set the width of this image as 100px,code width ="100"
  ex: <img src="https://mimo.app/i/earth.png"width="100"height="200">
- attributes add additional information to tags.

STYLESHEET AND BASIC SELECTORS:
- CSS stands for cascading stylesheet.
- to include a style sheet in an html file, we use the link element. <link> is a self closing empty element and it goes inside the head element.
- to know what kind of file to include,the opening link tag needs the rel attribute set using rel="stylesheet".
- to specify the style sheets's location,set the href attribute to "style.css".
- when we add p { followed by color: blue; and then },we create css rule.
  p
  { color:blur;
  }
- if we want a style to apply to the entire page,we can use the body selector.
  body{
  }
-
